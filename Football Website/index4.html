            <h3 class="first-box">George McFaull hits header that lands short of goal, Edwin Newcombe-Rodgers boots it in top left for an own goal in important final game</h3>
            <h3 class="second-box">Yong Sun skills entire first XI football team in first game of football ever played, does rainbow flick into a bicycle kick to score winning goal for team</h3>
            <h3 class="third-box">George McFaull recieves golden boot after claiming to have scored 143 goals throughout the season. His team only managed to score 4 goals past the keeper all year. This causes suspicion throughout the students of CBHS about George McFaull's claim.</h3>
            <h3 class="filler">Football is a sport played by hitting a ball using any part of the body except for the hands. If you touch the ball with your hands then the other team gets to kick it. Football is a compound word containing the words "Foot" and "Ball". This is likely related to how Football is played, with your feet, and a ball. Europe is pretty good at football, the United states of America don't like football too much, as they play gridiron, but call it "Football", even though you use your hands. Football probably started in England or something, and has since spread to where the British Empire spread. The best football player ever is usually regarded as being Argentine footballer Lionel Andr√©s Messi, or Portugese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo. A Football is generally patterned with many white hexagons, with some of the hexagons made black.</h3>
