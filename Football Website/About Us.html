            <h3 class="eighth-box">Christchurch Boys’ High School has a long, proud tradition of success at both local levels and national levels in football. The 1st XI performs in the Canterbury Secondary Schools’ Championship which is held on Wednesday afternoons to evenings. Upon qualifying the 1st XI will then compete in the New Zealand Secondary Schools Premiership in August. To be eligible for the 1st XI football team you do not have to play for the school on a Saturday but we encourage this to support our CBHS club programme. Saturday teams compete in the Mainland Football club competition in the U14, U15, U17 and U19 levels. These teams are open to all boys wanting to play football for the school. The Saturday teams are usually of mixed player ability and they are run by volunteer coaches and managers, often parents.</h3>
